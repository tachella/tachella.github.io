I am a research scientist at the French National Centre for Scientific Research [CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/), working at the [Sisyph laboratory](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/PHYSIQUE/teams/signaux-systemes-physique), [École Normale Supérieure de Lyon](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/) (Lyon, France). I am also the co-founder and CSO of [Blur Labs](https://blurlabs.ai/).

My work lies at the intersection of signal processing and machine learning. I am particularly interested in the theory of imaging inverse problems and applications in computational imaging.


I am a lead developer of the [deep inverse](https://deepinv.github.io/deepinv/), an open-source library for solving inverse problems with deep learning.
