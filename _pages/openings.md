We are looking for highly motivated students/postdocs who want to do research in machine learning and signal processing in a stimulating environent at ENS Lyon, in the beautiful city of Lyon, France.

### Postdoc positions

We don't have currently open postdoc positions, but do not hesitate to get in touch if you would like to do a postdoc in the lab.

### Master Internships and PhD scholarships

 If you are interested in doing your master internship (M2) or a PhD thesis with us, send me an email to julian.tachella@cnrs.fr explaining the topics you would like to work on, your CV and a transcript of grades. To get an idea about our current research projects, please check out the [recent papers](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=u_hH-fUAAAAJ&hl=en). Projects usually involve both theory and applied work and require some knowledge in statistics, machine learning, signal processing and optimization.
